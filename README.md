The main goal of the project is a typeescript application using `tsoa` for documentation generation, validation and routing. 

Most compilers (`tsx`, `ts-node`,... ) have problems with decorators or overall with ESM, `swc` of course has more support and speed. But it has problems too.

ESM in the context of typescript is Pandora box.
